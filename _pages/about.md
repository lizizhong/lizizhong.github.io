Hello!
I am a CS Ph.D. student at the University of California, Davis, advised by [Dr.Jiawei Zhang](http://jiaweizhang.net). Prior to UC Davis, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science from Tongji University in Shanghai, China. 

My research interest lies in natural language processing, specifically in nonparametric language modeling, misinformation & information retrieval, and multi-modal generative models.
