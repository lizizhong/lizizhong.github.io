The proliferation of fake news has emerged as a critical issue in recent years, requiring sig- nificant efforts to detect it. However, the ex- isting fake news detection datasets are sourced from human journalists, which are likely to have inherent bias limitations due to the highly subjective nature of this task. In this paper, we revisit the existing fake news dataset veri- fied by human journalists with augmented fact- checking by large language models (ChatGPT), and we name the augmented fake news dataset ChatGPT-FC. We quantitatively analyze the distinctions and resemblances between human journalists and LLM in assessing news sub- ject credibility, news creator credibility, time- sensitive, and political framing. Our findings highlight LLMâ€™s potential to serve as a prelim- inary screening method, offering a promising avenue to mitigate the inherent biases of human journalists and enhance fake news detection.
